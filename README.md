# XPDeathDropFix
        Tired of the stupid limit on xp drops on death? Do you wish that if you had 10,000 XP it dropped 5,000 (Like its SUPPOSED to), rather than 100? Then this is the plugin for you!

The actual method that XP drops are calculated is a little strange. As quoted from the Minecraft Wiki: "drops experience orbs with a precise total value of player last level Ã— 7 experience points (with a maximum of 100).". This plugin scraps that system and changes it to something way more simple. When you die, you drop exactly half of your total EXP, with no limit to it. You'll barely notice a difference over the vanilla method and you won't have to worry about returning to your deathbed with only a little over 7 levels at most.
